# Animal Sounds {data-background-color="#FFCD00"}

::: {.r-stack}
Detecting primate vocalizations in a jungle of audio recordings
:::

## Background

::: {.theme-section}
Biodiversity monitoring in tropical rainforests in relation to wood logging certification

<br> 

Bioacoustic monitoring: 

-   is a non-invasive method to monitor biodiversity
-   dense canopy makes visual monitoring difficult

:::

## {data-background-image="images/Slide6.jpg"}


## Challenges and objectives
::: {.theme-section-large}
-   Data processing requires automation
-   Machine learning requires labeled data
-   Low vocalization density
-   Training data is not available
-   Noisy environment
:::

## {data-background-image="images/Slide8.jpg"}

## Challenges and objectives
::: {.theme-section}
-   Can we use data from a zoo to train a model, and detect vocalizations in the wild?
-   If so > create a pipeline to automate the process for reuse in other projects

## Deep learning Models - CNN

::: {.theme-section}
<div style="font-size: 0.8em;">
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

- Convolutional layer
  - Detects features e.g., edges, textures, by applying filters
- Pooling layer: 
  - Reduces the dimensionality of feature maps 
- Fully Connected layer
  - maps the features to the final output

## How does CNN work?
::: {.theme-section}
- Input: Raw data, often an image (e.g., 32x32 RGB image).
- 1: Apply convolutional filters to detect features like edges, corners, textures.
- 2: Use pooling to reduce the size of feature maps (e.g., from 32x32 to 16x16).
- 3: Pass the output through fully connected layers for classification.

## How doe we change audio to image?
::: {.theme-section}
<b>Spectrogram</b>
- represents the intensity of different frequencies as they change over time, typically using a color map 

<b>Log-mel-spectrogram </b> a variation of the standard spectrogram that applies a filter bank and a log function on top of it. 

-	making quieter sounds more detectable.

-	Aligns the representation with human auditory perception

-	Normalizes the features

## Model Architecture - Derived from PANNs
::: {.theme-section}

PANNs: Large-Scale Pretrained Audio Neural Networks for Audio Pattern Recognition

- designed for audio event detection and classification

- a combination of convolutional blocks and pooling operations
