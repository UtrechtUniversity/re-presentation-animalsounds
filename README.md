## Getting Started:

Quarto is an open source publishing system for creating (documentation) websites, presentations and books. Quarto allows you to write content using markdown, and you can create dynamic content using (among others) R and Python. Quarto will render your markdown(`.qmd`) or e.g. notebooks (`.ipynb`) to HTML, PDF, and more. The repository includes a GitHub actions workflow to automatically render the presentation to HTML and publish it to GitHub pages.

- [Install Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)
- Open the `.qmd` file in RStudio or VS Code and start working on your presentation. 
- Both [Rstudio](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html) and [VS Code](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/vscode.html) have Quarto extensions that can be installed and used to preview your presentation on your PC.
- Commit and push your changes to GitHub.
